This repository documents my learning journey of SystemVerilog and UVM.
The SystemVerilog part follows Cadence’s SystemVerilog for Design and Verification v25.03 course, including corresponding labs.
The UVM part also follows Cadence's SystemVerilog Acclerated Verification using UVM v1.2.6, including labs.
The book SystemVerilog for Verification is a helper.
